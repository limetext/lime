# What is Lime?

I love the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor. [I have](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang) [created](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava) [several](https://github.com/quarnster/CompleteSharp) [plugins](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB) [to make](https://github.com/quarnster/ADBView) it even better. One thing that scares me though is that it is not open sourced and the [pace of nightly releases](http://www.sublimetext.com/nightly) have recently been anything but nightly, even now that version 3 is out in Beta.

There was a period of about 6 months after the Sublime Text 2 "stable" version was released where pretty much nothing at all was communicated to the users about what to expect in the future, nor was there much support offered in the forums. People including myself were wondering if the product was dead and I personally wondered what would happen to all the bugs, crashes and annoyances that still existed in ST2. This lack of communication is a dealbreaker to me and I decided that I will not spend any more money on that product because of it.

As none of the other text editors I've tried come close to the love I had for Sublime Text, I decided I had to create my own.

The frontend(s) are not ready to replace your favourite editor, but the backend itself I believe isn't too far away.

### Why create a clone?

Because I like the architecture of the extensibilities in the original editor.

# Goals

- ☑ 100% Open source
- ☑ Compatible with Textmate color schemes (which is what ST is using)
- ☑ Compatible with Textmate syntax definitions (which again is what ST is using)
- ☐ Compatible with Textmate snippets
- ☑ Compatible with Sublime Text’s python plugin API. I’ll probably never implement this 100%, only the api bits I need for the plugins I use.
- ☑ Compatible with Sublime Text’s keybindings and settings (think most of it is working)
- ☐ Compatible with Sublime Text snippets
- ☐ Sublime Text’s Goto anything panel
- ☑ Multiple cursors
- ☑ Regression tests (Programming in [Go](http://golang.org) makes it trivial and even fun to write them ;))
- ☐ Support for plugging in a custom parser for more advanced syntax highlighting.
- ☐ Terminal UI (*Maybe* I’ll work on a simple non-terminal UI at some point)
- ☐ Cross platform (It appears to be compiling and running on OSX and Linux last I tried, but needs further validation.)

# Build instructions

### Install required components

- [cmake](http://cmake.org/)
- Some form of build system that cmake can create a build system for (ninja, make, visual studio)
- Git
- Other required components will be downloaded as needed

### Download the needed repositories

	cd place/where/you/put/code
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/limetext/lime.git lime

### Compile lime

        cd lime
	mkdir build2
	cd build2
	cmake ..
	make
	make test

Done!

# To use termbox frontend
