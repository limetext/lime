### 1. The issues list is for development purposes only.

All issues reported here should result in **code being changed, added and/or removed**.

For support requests, please use [limetext/support](https://github.com/limetext/support) instead.


### 2. Issues should be opened up in the correct repository.

All issues reported here should result in code being changed, added and/or removed **in *this* repository**. If the issue relates to a different package, please file it there. There are a number of supporting packages maintained by us, which can be found [here](https://github.com/limetext).


### 3. Feature requests belong here, unless they can be implemented via a plugin.

If the feature can be implemented via a plugin it fails by proxy to satisfy [#2](https://github.com/limetext/lime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#2-issues-should-be-openened-up-in-the-correct-repository).


### 4. Bug reports belong here.

Bug reports should include a description of current behaviour and the expected behaviour in cases where this isn't obvious.

User errors where the error does not result in a code change count as support and fail to satisfy [#1](https://github.com/limetext/lime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-the-issues-list-is-for-development-purposes-only).

### 5. If you'd like to help but don't know how.

There's plenty of work that needs to be done, requiring a wide variety of skills and skill levels. The [Contributing wiki page](https://github.com/limetext/lime/wiki/Contributing) is a good place to start for some ideas.

There isn't a roadmap with well staked out milestones along the way where we can just give you a specific task to work on if you are up for anything within your skill level, and the few [volunteers](https://github.com/limetext/lime/graphs/contributors) who are activily involved at the moment are already having a hard time managing everything.

This is after all not a commercially backed project and any time spent here by our volunteers is their own spare time that they kindly donate to the project instead of spending time with friends, family and other interests.

We do need your help. Even if its just 5 minutes every month, that's 1 hour a year. If we could get just 0.1% of the people who have starred this project to donate 5 minutes every month it'd be a total of ~100 man hours per year and a significant impact on the project.
